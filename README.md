## 📝 Task 1: Reverse Words in a Sentence

### 🔧 Requirements:
- Write a program using functions that:
  - Asks the user for a long string containing multiple words.
  - Prints back the same string with the words in reverse order.

### 📝 Notes:
- The program meets the requirements efficiently by reversing the order of words and printing the result.
- Example Input: `I love programming in Dart.`  
  Example Output: `Dart. in programming love I`
- The task could also be implemented using a stack for a more structured approach.

## 🎨 Task 2: Profile Screen UI Design

### 🔗 Figma Design:
I based my implementation on the [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/HoIqcn4iy7R0OfTYIANgsD/Profile-screen-ui-Design-(Community)?node-id=1-315&p=f&t=E4NM0KbQ2RmKpGov-0).

### 🛠️ Implementation:
- Built the UI in Flutter to closely follow the Figma design.
- Made slight adjustments to the logic and layout to enhance usability while maintaining the design's core idea.
- Used a clean and organized structure to ensure readability and maintainability of the code.
